# Purpose

Here I'll explore the relationship between leafhopper density and leafhopper damage.

# Load Data

```{r data, echo=TRUE}
damage2017 <- read_rds(here('data', 'cleaned', '2017_treatment_data.rds'))
damage2018 <- read_rds(here('data', 'cleaned', '2018_treatment_data.rds'))
```

## Data Dictionary

The two damage dataframes contain data from the experimental treatments and the leaf image analysis.

- `cultivar`: Q = qing xin da mao, J = jin guan yin, L = long jing #43
- `sample`: sample ID
- `mean_leaf_area_px`: mean leaf area in pixels for that plant
- `mean_percent_damage`: mean percent damage for that plant
- `n_leaves`: number of leaves scanned for that plant
- `twister_damage`: the percent damage on the leaf the twister was placed on for DCSE
- `plant_num`: an identifier
- **NOTE**: leafhopper densities are in insects/young leaf for 2017 and insects/shoot for 2018 and not directly comparable.
- `density_treatment`: the density of leafhoppers I was aiming for
- `density_start`: the density of leafhoppers I actually got
- `density_end`: the density of leafhoppers recovered at the end of the feeding period

# Analysis
## 2017 Relationship between density and damage

Let's check the relationship between leafhopper density and damage

```{r echo=FALSE}
dens_dam_2017 <-
  ggplot(damage2017, aes(x = density_end, y = mean_percent_damage, label = sample)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(data = damage2017 %>% filter(mean_percent_damage > 10)) +
  labs(x = "Final leafhopper density (insects / young leaf)",
       y = "Mean % damaged leaf area",
       subtitle = "2017") +
  theme_bw()

dens_dam_2017 
damage2017 %>% filter(sample == "Q2")
```

Q2 stands out as extreme.  Inspection of the images shows that it includes 3 leaves with heavy hopperburn.

For example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here::here("img", "plant_2_leaf_6.png"))
```

Even without this sample, there is clearly not a perfectly linear relationship between leafhopper density and damage.

__Without sample Q2:__

```{r}
damage2017 <- damage2017 %>% filter(sample != "Q2")

#re-make plot
dens_dam_2017 <-
  ggplot(damage2017, aes(x = density_end, y = mean_percent_damage, label = sample)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.75) +
  labs(x = "Final leafhopper density (insects / young leaf)",
       y = "Mean % damaged leaf area",
       subtitle = "2017") +
  theme_bw()
dens_dam_2017
```
## 2017 Relationship between mean and twister leaf damage

```{r}
cor.test(damage2017$twister_damage, damage2017$mean_percent_damage)
```

Pretty strongly correlated. 0.72

## 2018 Relationship between density and damage

Let's check the relationship between leafhopper density and damage

```{r echo=FALSE}
dens_dam_2018 <-
  ggplot(damage2018, aes(x = density_end, y = mean_percent_damage, color = cultivar, label = sample)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(data = damage2018 %>% filter(mean_percent_damage > 7)) +
  labs(x = "Final leafhopper density (insects / shoot)",
       y = "Mean % damaged leaf area",
       subtitle = "2018") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Cultivar", labels = c("J" = "JGY", "L" = "LJ")) +
  theme_bw()

dens_dam_2018
damage2018 %>% filter(sample == "J23")
```

J23 has really high damage. It has 3 completely dead leaves, which maybe should be excluded.

For example:
```{r}
include_graphics(here("img", "leaf 31.png"))
```

__Without sample J23:__

```{r}
damage2018 <- damage2018 %>% filter(sample != "J23")

#re-create plot
dens_dam_2018 <-
  ggplot(damage2018,
         aes(x = density_end, y = mean_percent_damage,
             color = fct_relevel(cultivar, "L"), shape = fct_relevel(cultivar, "L"),
             label = sample)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.75) +
  labs(x = "Final leafhopper density (insects / shoot)",
       y = "Mean % damaged leaf area",
       subtitle = "2018") +
  # scale_color_discrete(name = "Cultivar", labels = c("L" = "LJ", "J" = "JGY")) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Cultivar", values = c("L" = "darkgreen", "J" = "purple"),
                     labels = c("L" = "LJ", "J" = "JGY")) +
  scale_shape_discrete(name = "Cultivar", labels = c("L" = "LJ", "J" = "JGY")) +
  theme_bw()
dens_dam_2018
```

## 2018 Relationship between mean and twister leaf damage
```{r}
damage2018 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(twister_damage)) %>% 
  cor.test( ~ twister_damage + mean_percent_damage, data = .)
```
Oh... huh.  Really not correlated at all.  Well, shit.

```{r}
ggplot(damage2018, aes(y = twister_damage, x = mean_percent_damage, color = cultivar)) +
  geom_point()
```


## Density vs. damage
For both years, so two panel figure
Add panel with leaf images.

First, figure out what low, medium, and high damage are.

```{r}
damage2017 %>% summarize(low = min(mean_percent_damage), max = max(mean_percent_damage), mid = median(mean_percent_damage))
#low = 0.566, mid = 1.883, high = 11.583
rawdamage2017 <- read_rds(here('data', 'cleaned', '2017_leaf_damage_new.rds'))
rawdamage2017 %>%
  filter(near(percent_damage, 10, tol = 0.01))
rawdamage2017 %>% arrange(desc(percent_damage))
```

Representative leaves:

- low: Q11 leaf 1, 0.56 % damage
- mid: Q9 leaf 3, 1.87% damage
- high: Q18 leaf 3, 12.68% damage (necrosis at leaf margins)
- high: Q13 leaf 7, 8.71% damage 

```{r}
low <- image_read(here::here("img", "low-damage.png")) %>%
  image_scale("x600") %>% 
  image_annotate("0.56%", size = 30, location = "+10+10")
mid<- image_read(here("img", "mid-damage.png")) %>%
  image_scale("x600") %>% 
  image_annotate("1.87%", size = 30, location = "+10+10")
high <- image_read(here("img", "high-damage.png")) %>%
  image_scale("x600") %>% 
  image_annotate("8.71%", size = 30, location = "+10+10")
high2 <- image_read(here("img", "high-damage2.png")) %>% 
  image_scale("x600") %>% 
  image_annotate("12.68%", size = 30, location = "+10+10")

leaf_examples <-
  image_append(c(low, mid, high, high2)) %>%
  image_border("white", "50x50") %>% 
  rasterGrob()
```

```{r}
dens_vs_dam <-
  plot_grid(dens_dam_2017 + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 12)),
            dens_dam_2018 + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 12)) +
              theme(legend.position = "none"), labels = c("B", "C")) %>% 
  plot_grid(get_legend(dens_dam_2018), rel_widths = c(1, 0.1))

dens_dam_full <-
  plot_grid(leaf_examples, dens_vs_dam,
          ncol = 1,
          labels = "A",
          rel_heights = c(0.75, 1))

dens_vs_dam
dens_dam_full
save_plot(here('figs', 'dam_dens_img.png'), dens_dam_full, ncol = 2, nrow = 2, base_asp = 1.1)
```
