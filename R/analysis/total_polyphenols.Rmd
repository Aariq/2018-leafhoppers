Total polyphenols were measured by Amma Agyei using the Folin-Ciocalteau assay Spring of 2019.

# Read in data

Total polyphenols data, leafhopper density data, and leaf damage data

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tp2017 <- read_csv(here("data", "raw", "2017 total polyphenols.csv"))
damage2017 <- read_rds(here('data', 'cleaned', '2017_treatment_data.rds'))

tp2018 <- read_csv(here("data", "raw", "2018 total polyphenols.csv"))
damage2018 <- read_rds(here('data', 'cleaned', '2018_treatment_data.rds'))
```

Join data sheets.

```{r}
tp2017 <- 
  tp2017 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  full_join(damage2017, by = "sample") %>%
  select(-leaf_density) #identical to `density_end`
tp2017
```
```{r}
tp2018 <- 
  tp2018 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  full_join(damage2018, by = "sample") %>%
  select(-leaf_density) #identical to `density_end`
tp2018
```


- sample: cultivar and sample ID. Q = qing xin da mao
- standard_deviation: from averaging triplicates
- mean_ga_equivalent: galic acid equivalents in mg/mL (i think)
- coefficient_of_variation: from averaging triplicates(?)
- leaf_density: leafhopper density at end of experiment in insects/young leaf
- mg_tea: mg of tea powder
- mg_g_gae: galic acid equivalents in mg/g of tea powder


These data are means of triplicate runs.
# 2017
## Regression with leafhopper density as predictor

Data seem normal enough to use a regular linear model

```{r}
shapiro.test(tp2017$mg_g_gae)
#normal enough
```

## Relationship between density and damage

Let's check the relationship between leafhopper density and damage

```{r echo=FALSE}
dens_dam_2017 <-
  ggplot(tp2017, aes(x = density_end, y = mean_percent_damage, label = sample)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(data = tp2017 %>% filter(mean_percent_damage > 10)) +
  labs(x = "Final leafhopper density (insects / young leaf)",
       y = "Mean % damaged leaf area",
       subtitle = "2017") +
  theme_bw()

dens_dam_2017 
```

Q2 stands out as extreme.  Inspection of the images shows that it includes 3 leaves with heavy hopperburn.

For example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here::here("docs", "plant_2_leaf_6.png"))
```

Even without this sample, there is clearly not a perfectly linear relationship between leafhopper density and damage.  Using damage as a predictor might give different results and would also allow me to potentially combine data from multiple years (although I did use a different classifier for the two years...I *could* re-do image analysis using the same classifier, or possibly re-train one on samples from both years.)

## Remove sample Q2

```{r}
tp2017 <- tp2017 %>% filter(sample != "Q2")
```

## Polyphenols vs. Density

I'll test for a quadratic or linear relationship.  **NOTE**: I could possibly do this by using # leafhoppers as a predictor and # leaves as an offset.  Not sure if that would be any different though.

```{r}
dens.poly.17 <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ poly(density_end, 2), data = tp2017)
dens.linear.17 <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ density_end, data = tp2017)
dens.null.17 <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ 1, data = tp2017)
AIC(dens.poly.17, dens.linear.17, dens.null.17)
# summary(dens.poly.17)
Anova(dens.poly.17)
```

Looks like best model is intercept only, although polynomial is maybe better than linear.  No significant relationship between leafhopper density and total phenolics, with a trend toward a polynomial relationship.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
ggplot(augment(dens.poly.17), aes(.resid)) + geom_histogram(bins = 15)
ggplot(augment(dens.poly.17), aes(sample = .resid)) + geom_qq() + geom_qq_line()
```


## Polyphenols vs. Damage

```{r}
dam.poly.17 <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ poly(mean_percent_damage, 2), data = tp2017)
dam.linear.17 <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ mean_percent_damage, data = tp2017)
dam.null.17 <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ 1, data = tp2017)
AIC(dam.poly.17, dam.linear.17, dam.null.17)
Anova(dam.poly.17)
```
Now, the polynomial model is the best and there is a marginally significant relationship with  % damage (p = `r round(Anova(dam.poly)[["Pr(>F)"]][1],3)`)


```{r echo=FALSE}
dam.2017.plot <-
  ggplot(tp2017, aes(x = mean_percent_damage, y = mg_g_gae)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ poly(x, 2)", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Mean % damaged leaf area",
       y = "Total polyphenols (mg/g GAE)",
       title = "2017",
       caption = "Sample Q2 removed") +
  theme_bw() +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 1.1, y = 3, label = glue("p = {round(Anova(dam.poly.17)$`Pr(>F)`[1], 3)}"))
dam.2017.plot
```


# 2018

## Regression with leafhopper density as predictor

Data seem normal enough to use a regular linear model

```{r}
shapiro.test(tp2018$mg_g_gae)
#normal enough
```

## Relationship between density and damage

Let's check the relationship between leafhopper density and damage

```{r echo=FALSE}
dens_dam_2018 <-
  ggplot(tp2018, aes(x = density_end, y = mean_percent_damage, color = cultivar, label = sample)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(data = tp2018 %>% filter(mean_percent_damage > 7)) +
  labs(x = "Final leafhopper density (insects / shoot)",
       y = "Mean % damaged leaf area",
       subtitle = "2018") +
  theme_bw()

dens_dam_2018
```

J23 has really high damage. It has 3 completely dead leaves, which maybe should be excluded.

For example:
```{r}
include_graphics(here("docs", "leaf 31.png"))
```

## Remove sample J23

```{r}
tp2018 <- tp2018 %>% filter(sample != "J23")
```

## Polyphenols vs. density

I'll test for a quadratic or linear relationship

```{r}
dens.poly.cv.18 <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ poly(density_end, 2)*cultivar, data = tp2018)
dens.poly.18 <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ poly(density_end, 2), data = tp2018)
dens.linear.cv.18 <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ density_end*cultivar, data = tp2018)
dens.linear.18 <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ density_end, data = tp2018)
dens.cv.18 <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ cultivar, data = tp2018)
dens.null.18 <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ 1, data = tp2018)
AIC(dens.poly.cv.18, dens.poly.18, dens.linear.cv.18, dens.linear.18, dens.cv.18, dens.null.18)
# lmtest::lrtest(dens.linear.cv.18)
# Anova(dens.cv.18)
```

The null model wins. No effect of cultivar or leafhopper density on total polyphenols.


## Polyphenols vs. damage

```{r}
dam.poly.cv <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ poly(mean_percent_damage, 2) * cultivar, data = tp2018)
dam.poly <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ poly(mean_percent_damage, 2), data = tp2018)
dam.linear.cv <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ mean_percent_damage * cultivar, data = tp2018)
dam.linear <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ mean_percent_damage, data = tp2018)
dam.cv <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ cultivar, data = tp2018)
dam.null <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ 1, data = tp2018)
AIC(dam.poly.cv, dam.poly, dam.linear.cv, dam.linear, dam.cv, dam.null)

# Anova(dam.linear)
```

The null model wins.  There is no effect of cultivar or leaf damage on total polyphenols for 2018.
