Total polyphenols were measured by Amma Agyei using the Folin-Ciocalteau assay Spring of 2019.

# Read in data

Total polyphenols data, leafhopper density data, and leaf damage data

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tp <- read_csv(here("data", "raw", "2017 total polyphenols.csv"))
damage <- read_rds(here('data', 'cleaned', '2017_treatment_data.rds'))
```

Join data sheets.

```{r}
tp2 <- 
  tp %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  full_join(damage, by = "sample") %>%
  select(-leaf_density) #identical to `density_end`
tp2
```

- sample: cultivar and sample ID. Q = qing xin da mao
- standard_deviation: from averaging triplicates
- mean_ga_equivalent: galic acid equivalents in mg/mL (i think)
- coefficient_of_variation: from averaging triplicates(?)
- leaf_density: leafhopper density at end of experiment in insects/young leaf
- mg_tea: mg of tea powder
- mg_g_gae: galic acid equivalents in mg/g of tea powder


These data are means of triplicate runs.

# Regression with leafhopper density as predictor

Data seem normal enough to use a regular linear model

```{r}
shapiro.test(tp2$mg_g_gae)
#normal enough
```
I'll test for a quadratic or linear relationship

```{r}
dens.poly <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ poly(density_end, 2), data = tp2)
dens.linear <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ density_end, data = tp2)
dens.null <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ 1, data = tp2)
AIC(dens.poly, dens.linear, dens.null)
# summary(dens.poly)
Anova(dens.poly)
```

Looks like best model is intercept only, although polynomial is maybe better than linear.  No significant relationship between leafhopper density and total phenolics, with a trend toward a polynomial relationship.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
ggplot(augment(dens.poly), aes(.resid)) + geom_histogram(bins = 15)
ggplot(augment(dens.poly), aes(sample = .resid)) + geom_qq() + geom_qq_line()
```


## Polyphenols vs. Density

```{r echo=FALSE}
p <-
  ggplot(tp2, aes(x = density_end, y = mg_g_gae)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ poly(x, 2)", se = TRUE) +
  labs(x = "Final leafhopper density (insects / shoot)",
       y = "Total polyphenols (mg/g GAE)") +
  theme_bw() +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 1.1, y = 4, label = glue("p = {round(Anova(dens.poly)$`Pr(>F)`[1], 3)}"))

p
# save_plot(here("figs", "2017 total polyphenols.png"), p.polished, base_aspect_ratio = 1.1)
```


# Relationship between density and damage

Let's check the relationship between leafhopper density and damage

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(tp2, aes(x = density_end, y = mean_percent_damage)) +
  geom_point() +
  gghighlight(mean_percent_damage > 7, use_direct_label = TRUE, label_key = sample) +
  labs(x = "Final leafhopper density (insects / shoot)",
       y = "Mean % damaged leaf area") +
  theme_bw()
```

Q2 stands out as extreme.  Inspection of the images shows that it includes 3 leaves with heavy hopperburn.

For example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here::here("docs", "plant_2_leaf_6.png"))
```

Even without this sample, there is clearly not a perfectly linear relationship between leafhopper density and damage.  Using damage as a predictor migh give different results and would also allow me to potentially combine data from multiple years (although I did use a different classifier for the two years...I *could* re-do image analysis using the same classifier, or possibly re-train one on samples from both years.)

# Regression with %damage as predictor

```{r}
dam.poly <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ poly(mean_percent_damage, 2), data = tp2)
dam.linear <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ mean_percent_damage, data = tp2)
dam.null <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ 1, data = tp2)
AIC(dam.poly, dam.linear, dam.null)
# summary(dam.linear)
Anova(dam.linear)
```
Now, the linear model is the best and there is a marginally significant linear relationship with  % damage (p = `r round(Anova(dam.linear)[["Pr(>F)"]][1],3)`)

## Polyphenols vs. Damage

```{r echo=FALSE}
p2 <-
  ggplot(tp2, aes(x = mean_percent_damage, y = mg_g_gae)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ x", se = FALSE)

p2 +
  labs(x = "Mean % damaged leaf area",
       y = "Total polyphenols (mg/g GAE)") +
  theme_bw() +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 1.1, y = 4, label = glue("p = {round(Anova(dam.linear)$`Pr(>F)`[1], 3)}"))
```


## If I remove sample Q2...

```{r}
tp3 <- tp2 %>% filter(sample != "Q2")
dam.poly.2 <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ poly(mean_percent_damage, 2), data = tp3)
dam.linear.2 <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ mean_percent_damage, data = tp3)
dam.null.2 <- lm(mg_g_gae ~ 1, data = tp3)
AIC(dam.poly.2, dam.linear.2, dam.null.2)
# summary(dam.poly.2)
Anova(dam.poly.2)
# Anova(dam.linear.2)
```

Then polynomial model is best and highly significant (the linear model is also highly significant) (p = `r round(Anova(dam.poly.2)[["Pr(>F)"]][1], 3)`

```{r echo=FALSE}
p3 <-
  ggplot(tp3, aes(x = mean_percent_damage, y = mg_g_gae)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ poly(x, 2)", se = TRUE) +
  labs(x = "Mean % damaged leaf area",
       y = "Total polyphenols (mg/g GAE)",
       caption = "Sample Q2 removed") +
  theme_bw() +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 1.1, y = 3, label = glue("p = {round(Anova(dam.poly.2)$`Pr(>F)`[1], 3)}"))
p3
```
